    <H1>Florida's Weather</H1>
    <!--Title of the web page-->
    <p>Looking to get away for a week or two? Trying to unwind and catch a tan? Then Florida is the place for you!</p>
    <h2 style="background-color:black;">Be sure to...</h1>
    <h2>Always be prepared!</h2>
    <p>The Florida heat can be <strong>extreme.</strong> It is <b>best</b> to be prepared and wear the appropriate gear for the weather. <i>Always</i> wear swimtrunks to the beach on warm days and bring a sweater for at night! Tempuratures tend to rise in the afternoon significantly and drop drastically towards the end of the day.</p>
    <p>It is best if you go during the odd months of the year if possible. The best time to depart is in early january as the least amount of people will flood the beaches. Its always best to enjoy a nice quiet peaceful vacation!</p>
    <p>There is nothing worse than spending your day in the sun and not bringing any sunscreen. Be sure to have some on hand and always apply the cream before soaking in the rays. Keep in mind the sun is a lot more powerful down south!</p>

    <h3>The Escape</h3>
    <p>Ever since I was a kid I found escaping from northern polar wind chills a <mark>breeze.</mark> Disney Land, Universal, and any other theme park that was around I would be begging my parents to take me.</p>
    <p> With the white sandy beaches, tourist attractions, and family fun, Florida makes for a great destination to bring the family! Every year the family and I head down south to enjoy the bright rays of sunshine. We also love to fish and compete against one another.</p>
    <p>A Florida fisherman once stated: <q>Always go to the bait shop before hitting the water and be sure you have the right bait.</q> If you do decide to try to fish, ask local fisherman what fish are biting. Having the correct bait on your line will have you reeling them in all day long making your trip worth it that much more.</p>
    <p>The next time you are looking for a get away consider heading south and soaking up the sunshine!</p>
