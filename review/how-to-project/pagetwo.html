                <h2>Setting up the logs!</h2>
                <p>It is very important in how you set the logs up for the fire. Be sure to set the logs up in an
                    upright position as seen in the photo to the right. These logs form a teepee looking formation.

                <h3>Fuel the fire!</h3>
                <p>You may use fire starters, gasoline, or anything that is flammable and safe to use. Not much is needed so only use small amounts. You may repeat this process every few minutes if you do not have results. Be sure when
                    using these products that you stand far enough away as these are combustible and will go up in flame
                    quickly.
                    Paper, cardboard, matches, and or a lighter usually do the trick when trying to initially spark a
                    flame.
