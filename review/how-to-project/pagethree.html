                <h2>Wait for it to die down</h2>
                <p>The best option in putting the fire out safely is letting the fire burn itself out. Once you see embers or red coals usually this indicates the fire is starting to slow down. Before puring water on the coals, be sure to be a sfae distance away from this. Lots of smoke tends to pour out from the coals once water is applied and it can burn your eyes!

                <h3>Keep your distance and check every so often</h3>
                <p>Now that you have successfully put the fire out, be sure to check back on it every so often to be sure it is fully out. You may apply more water to this if need be.
                Smoke may still be coming off the pit and this is okay, keep any people or pets away from the pit until it is fully out. At this point in time, there should be no smoke, or red coals in your pit.
